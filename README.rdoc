== Async Upload App

Basic async upload using Filesystem API and Drag and Drop HTML5 API.

When starting an upload, it creates a temporary cache of the files, and returns an HTML with the
cached path, so that it is not necessary to upload again when submitting the form.

Tested using ruby 1.9.3-p194

== Getting Started

  bundle install
  rackup

== TODO

* upload in batches
* remove uploaded file
* when submitting a form, wait for all uploads to finish
